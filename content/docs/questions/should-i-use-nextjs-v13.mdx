> Should I migrate my app to Next.js v13, or should I keep using v12 until v13 is stable?

Version 13 _is_ stable, same for any version numbers of Next.js on the stable channel (i.e., not `canary`).

As of v13.4.0 (4 May 2023), the app router is also stable.

Keep in mind though that as of 4 May 2023, [Server Actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions) are still in alpha (so not stable).
