> How do I use X in the app router?

- **`next-auth`**: As of 23 May 2023 the documentation on how to use `next-auth` with the app router has been published, please go [here](https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/initialization#route-handlers-app) to get started.

- **tRPC**: See [this sample repo](https://github.com/trpc/next-13), but to be fair I don't recommend using tRPC with the app router.

- **UI libraries**: See [this section](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#third-party-packages) in the documentation. For libraries that have a provider, [this section](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#rendering-third-party-context-providers-in-server-components) might be relevant.
