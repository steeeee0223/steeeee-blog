          I am <Link href={GITHUB_URL}>@joulev</Link>, a Next.js user, an active helper and

          This website is a collection of the answers that some active server members and I have for
          some of the most commonly asked questions on the server. I found myself answering these
          questions over and over again so I decided why not make something so I can simply answer
          with a URL instead.
